Hi Engineer!

Thank you so much for downloading the Matoi Vanilla Pack.
With any of your support, you greatly help the development of the addon.

Before using the add-on, I ask you to read the license agreement in the License file.

I also recommend you to visit our Discord server!

For any similar and many other reasons:

- If you have any suggestion / correction / wish;
- If you want to add your color to the model, but do not know how it is most convenient to do it;
- If you want to make your texel style models in MVP or you need help with this;
- If you just want to have a good time and always be aware of any changes and updates in MVP;

In the near future we plan to launch our Minecraft Survival-RP server 
with MVP and a bunch of interesting railway RP scenarios.
